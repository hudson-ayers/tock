                //
                // ## Explanation and Rationale

                // This panic represents a tradeoff. While it is undesirable to
                // have the potential for a runtime crash in this grant region
                // code, it balances usability with type correctness. The
                // challenge is that calling `self.apps.iter()` is a common
                // pattern in capsules to access the grant region of every app
                // that is using the capsule, and sometimes it is intuitive to
                // call that inside of a `self.apps.enter(app_id, |app| {...})`
                // closure. However, `.enter()` means that app's grant region is
                // entered, and then a naive `.iter()` would re-enter the grant
                // region and cause undefined behavior. We considered different
                // options to resolve this.
                //
                // 1. Have `.iter()` only iterate over grant regions which are
                //    not entered. This avoids the bug, but could lead to
                //    unexpected behavior, as `self.apps.iter()` will do
                //    different things depending on where in a capsule it is
                //    called.
                // 2. Have the compiler detect when `.iter()` is called when a
                //    grant region has already been entered. We don't know of a
                //    viable way to implement this.
                // 3. Panic if `.iter()` is called when a grant is already
                //    entered.
                //
                // We decided on option 3 because it balances minimizing
                // surprises (`self.apps.iter()` will always iterate all grants)
                // while also protecting against the bug. We expect that any
                // code that attempts to call `self.apps.iter()` after calling
                // `.enter()` will immediately encounter this `panic!()` and
                // have to be refactored before any tests will be successful.
                // Therefore, this `panic!()` should only occur at
                // development/testing time.
                //
                // ## How to fix this error
                //
                // If you are seeing this panic, you need to refactor your
                // capsule to not call `.iter()` or `.each()` from inside a
                // `.enter()` closure. That is, you need to close the grant
                // region you are currently in before trying to iterate over all
                // grant regions.
